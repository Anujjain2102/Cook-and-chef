Important Considerations

	•	Limitations: Free hosting services usually come with limitations like restricted bandwidth, storage, or access to certain features (e.g., limited database size, slower performance, or limited support).
	•	Custom Domains: Most platforms allow you to connect a custom domain, but you may need to use a paid domain (which can be found cheaply via providers like Namecheap or Google Domains).
	•	Performance: Free hosting plans often come with limited resources, meaning performance could degrade if traffic increases. Consider upgrading to a paid plan as your traffic grows.
	•	Security: Ensure that you’re using HTTPS (SSL/TLS certificates), which most platforms provide for free. For example, GitHub Pages, Netlify, and Vercel all support HTTPS by default.
	•	Backup & Recovery: Free hosting providers might not offer backups, so it’s good practice to keep copies of your website files locally or in cloud storage.

Conclusion:

For static websites, GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel are the best free options with excellent developer workflows. For dynamic websites, Firebase Hosting, Heroku, and InfinityFree are solid choices. Make sure to start small, and as your project grows, you may need to switch to a paid hosting solution for more features, better scalability, and support.
