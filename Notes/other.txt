Your proposed stack covers a robust and modern software development workflow for building and deploying a full-stack application. However, depending on the nature, scale, and goals of your project, you might consider adding or refining certain tools and technologies. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **1. Security**
- **Authentication and Authorization**: 
  - **OAuth/OpenID**: Tools like **Keycloak** or **Auth0** for user authentication.
  - **Spring Security**: If using Spring Boot for backend, it integrates seamlessly.
- **Secrets Management**: Use **AWS Secrets Manager** or **HashiCorp Vault** for securely managing API keys, database credentials, etc.

---

### **2. Testing**
- **Frontend Testing**: 
  - **Jest** and **React Testing Library** for unit and integration tests.
- **Backend Testing**: 
  - **JUnit** for Spring Boot.
  - **Postman** or **Newman** for API testing.
- **End-to-End Testing**: 
  - Tools like **Cypress** or **Selenium**.

---

### **3. Caching**
- Add a caching layer if performance optimization is required:
  - **Redis** or **Memcached** for in-memory data caching.

---

### **4. API Management**
- Consider an API Gateway if your application might scale to multiple microservices:
  - **AWS API Gateway** or **Kong** for managing APIs.

---

### **5. Data Analytics and ETL**
- If your project involves data analysis or real-time analytics:
  - **Apache Kafka** or **AWS Kinesis** for event streaming.
  - **AWS Glue** or **Apache Spark** for ETL processes.

---

### **6. Documentation**
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: Generate API documentation for your backend endpoints.
- **MkDocs** or **Read the Docs**: For project documentation.

---

### **7. Observability**
While you have the **ELK Stack** for logging, consider:
- **Prometheus and Grafana**: For metrics collection and dashboard visualization.
- **AWS CloudWatch**: For AWS-native monitoring and logging.

---

### **8. Frontend Enhancements**
- **State Management**: Use **Redux** or **Context API** for managing state in React.
- **Styling**: Tools like **Tailwind CSS**, **Material-UI**, or **Chakra UI** for UI components.

---

### **9. Performance Optimization**
- **CDN**: Use AWS CloudFront for distributing frontend assets globally.
- **Image Optimization**: Tools like **Cloudinary** for optimizing and serving images.

---

### **10. Development and Collaboration Tools**
- **Task Management**: Tools like **Jira**, **Trello**, or **Asana** for planning and tracking tasks.
- **Code Review**: Use **GitHub Pull Requests** or **GitLab Merge Requests** for collaborative coding.

---

### **Optional Additions for Specific Needs**
- **GraphQL**: If your APIs need flexible query capabilities.
- **NoSQL Alternatives**: Consider **DynamoDB** for AWS-native NoSQL.
- **Search Engine**: Integrate **Elasticsearch** or **AWS OpenSearch** if your application requires advanced search capabilities.

---

### **Summary**
Your stack is already quite comprehensive. If you're building a standard personal project, you may not need all of the additional tools listed above. However, consider adding **security, testing, and caching** as they’re crucial for robustness. Start simple and iterate as the project grows.
